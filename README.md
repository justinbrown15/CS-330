1.	How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by breaking the big problem into smaller chunks. These are much more manageable.
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It helped me to understand more about openGL. I learned how to draw objects, texture them, and even light them.
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started with a whole picture of a scene. Then each week worked on a small piece of the scene. By the end the whole picture was created.
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
A big thing that I learned was how to look at long lines of code, and figure out what was going on.
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs first by understanding what it is I want to create. Then I focus on breaking the big problem into small pieces.
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I learned how to be presented with a lot of information and only pick out what was relevant.
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
I created a small piece of the program throughout the course. Which greatly factored into me being able to develop this.
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I thought that going through the code each week was fairly difficult. By the end of the milestones though I was surprised with how much I actually learned by the end!
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
It can help me think and also provide a service to society.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
It gave me the ability to look at huge amounts of code and piece everything together. I really feel like I learned a lot with this course.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The skills that this class gave me was already addressed above. However, to reiterate, I learned how to be presented with tough material and break it down into mangeable chunks. I also learned how to be given a bunch of new information, but only focus on what is relevant to complete the task at hand. You don’t have to be a complete master of the tools before you start to use them.
